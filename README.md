# 📊 Business Sales Analysis with SQL – Superstore Dataset

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project focuses on performing **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** using SQL on the popular Superstore dataset. The analysis uncovers trends, customer behavior, sales distribution, and product performance across time, categories, and geographies. Advanced SQL techniques such as **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** and **Window Functions** were applied to extract valuable business insights.
